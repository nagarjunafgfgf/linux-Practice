Library Functions:
``````````````````
- The Linux library functions are the C standard library.
- The C standard library is also called as libc.
- The C standard library provides header files that needs to be included in user’s application program, in order to use the standard library function calls.
- A library is a collection of pre-compiled  code.
- The library contains several functions together and they form a package or library. The library help to reuse the code by avoiding writing same code again and again.
- For example, the standard C library provide ‘stdio.h’ header file, and this header file has to be included in user program inorder to use the library function ‘printf’.
- Some Library functions are designed over the system calls, inorder to provide more additional functionality in the library functions.


System Call:
````````````
- A system call can be considered as a interface through which the User application code enters Kernel mode.
- Thus the system runs in kernel mode on behalf of the user program during system call execution.
- System calls can be invoked from user application in 2 ways.
A) Directly calling the system call
B) The user code calls the library function, and this inturn calls system calls when required.
- Few examples of system calls are
open(), close(), read(), write() etc.
- The system calls called through library functions are example
printf(), inturn calls the write() system call
